## Exercises
- What is an example of an operating system as: Referee, Illusionist and Glue?
  - **As Referee, an operating system plays the role of a fair and impartial mediator, ensuring that all applications and users have equal access to the system's resources and that no one application or user can monopolize these resources.** For example, an operating system might prevent one program from using all of the available memory, thus ensuring that other programs have enough memory to run smoothly.
  - **As Illusionist, an operating system creates the illusion of a larger, more powerful computer than actually exists.** For example, an operating system might provide a virtual memory system that makes it appear as if there is more memory available than there actually is. This allows programs to use more memory than would be possible on a physical computer with the same amount of RAM.
  - **As Glue, an operating system provides a common set of services that applications can use, such as file I/O, networking, and security.** This allows applications to be written without having to worry about the underlying details of the hardware.
- What is the difference, if any, between the following terms:
  **Reliability vs. availability:**
  * **Reliability** refers to the ability of a system to perform its intended function correctly and consistently, even in the face of errors or failures.
  * **Availability** refers to the ability of a system to be accessed and used when needed.
  
  **Security vs. privacy:**
  * **Security** refers to the measures taken to protect a system from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
  * **Privacy** refers to the right of individuals to control the collection, use, and disclosure of their personal information.
  
  **Security enforcement vs. security policy:**
  * **Security enforcement** refers to the mechanisms used to implement a security policy.
  * **Security policy** refers to the rules and guidelines that govern the security of a system.
  
  **Throughput vs. response time:**
  * **Throughput** refers to the rate at which a system can process tasks.
  * **Response time** refers to the amount of time it takes for a system to respond to a request.
  
  **Efficiency vs. overhead:**
  * **Efficiency** refers to the ability of a system to perform a task with minimal use of resources.
  * **Overhead** refers to the additional resources required to implement a system or feature.
  
  **Application programming interface (API) vs. abstract virtual machine (AVM):**
  * An **API** is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.
  * An **AVM** is a software environment that provides an abstraction of the underlying hardware, allowing developers to write code that can run on multiple platforms.
  
  **Abstract virtual machine (AVM) vs. hardware abstraction layer (HAL):**   
    **AVM** provides a consistent interface for applications to interact with the operating system, regardless of the underlying hardware. This makes it easier to port applications to different platforms.
    
    **HAL** provides a layer of abstraction between the operating system and the hardware. This allows the operating system to be more portable and to support a wider range of hardware.
    
    **Both AVM and HAL are essential for creating portable and efficient operating systems**. They provide a way to hide the details of the underlying hardware from applications and to make it easier to develop and maintain operating systems.
  
  **Proprietary vs. open operating system:**
  * A **proprietary operating system** is owned and controlled by a single company.
  * An **open operating system** is freely available and can be modified and distributed by anyone.
  
  **Batch vs. interactive operating system:**
  * A **batch operating system** processes jobs in batches, without user interaction.
  * An **interactive operating system** allows users to interact with the system directly, through a command-line interface or graphical user interface.
  
  **Host vs. guest operating system:**
  * A **host operating system** is the primary operating system that runs on a computer.
  * A **guest operating system** is a virtual operating system that runs within a host operating system, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single computer.
- Define the term, direct memory access (DMA).
  - **Direct memory access (DMA)** is a way for hardware I/O devices to transfer data directly into/out of main memory at a location specified by the operating system. This allows data to be transferred without the involvement of the CPU, which can improve performance.
- For the following questions, take a moment to speculate. We provide answers to these questions throughout the book, but, given what you know now, how would you answer them? Before there were operating systems, someone needed to develop solutions without being able to look them up! How would you have designed the first operating system?

  - Suppose a computer system and all of its applications were completely bug free. Suppose further that everyone in the world were completely honest and trustworthy. In other words, we need not consider fault isolation.
    - How should an operating system allocate time on the processor? Should it give the entire processor to each application until it no longer needs it? If there were multiple tasks ready to go at the same time, should it schedule first the task with the least amount of work to do or the one with the most? Justify your answer.
      - **The operating system should allocate time on the processor by giving each application a time slice.** This ensures that all applications get a chance to run and no one application monopolizes the processor. If there are multiple tasks ready to go at the same time, the operating system should schedule the task with the least amount of work to do first. This will help to keep the system responsive and prevent any one task from taking too long to complete.

    - How should the operating system allocate physical memory to applications? What should happen if the set of applications does not fit in memory at the same time?
      - **The operating system should allocate physical memory to applications by dividing the memory into fixed-size pages.** Each application is then assigned a set of pages that it can use. If an application needs more memory, it can request additional pages from the operating system. If the system does not have enough free memory to satisfy the request, the operating system can either kill the application or swap some of its pages out to disk.
    - How should the operating system allocate its disk space? Should the first user to ask acquire all of the free space? What would the likely outcome be for that policy?
      - **The operating system should allocate disk space to applications by dividing the disk into fixed-size blocks.** Each application is then assigned a set of blocks that it can use. If an application needs more space, it can request additional blocks from the operating system. If the system does not have enough free space to satisfy the request, the operating system can either kill the application or delete some of its files.
      - **The first user to ask for disk space should not be allowed to acquire all of the free space.** This would prevent other users from being able to use the disk. Instead, the operating system should allocate disk space fairly among all users.

  - Now suppose the computer system needs to support fault isolation. What hardware and/or operating support do you think would be needed to do the following?
    **<ins>Supporting fault isolation requires the following hardware and/or operating support: </ins>**
    
    * **Memory protection:** Hardware support to prevent one process from accessing the memory of another process.
    * **Privileged instructions:** Instructions that can only be executed by the operating system kernel.
    * **Timer interrupts:** The ability for the operating system kernel to periodically regain control of the processor.
    * **The process abstraction:** A mechanism to isolate each application from other applications and the operating system kernel.
  - How should an operating system support communication between applications? Explain your reasoning.
    - Through the file system?
    - Through messages passed between applications?
    - Through regions of memory shared between the applications?
    - All of the above?
    - None of the above?
- How would you design combined hardware and software support to provide the illusion of a nearly infinite virtual memory on a limited amount of physical memory?
- How would you design a system to run an entire operating system as an application on top of another operating system?
- How would you design a system to update complex data structures on disk in a consistent fashion despite machine crashes?
- Society itself must grapple with managing resources. What ways do governments use to allocate resources, isolate misuse, and foster sharing in real life?
- Suppose you were tasked with designing and implementing an ultra-reliable and ultra-available operating system. What techniques would you use? What tests, if any, might be sufficient to convince you of the systemâ€™s reliability, short of handing your operating system to millions of users to serve as beta testers?
- MTTR, and therefore availability, can be improved by reducing the time to reboot a system after a failure. What techniques might you use to speed up booting? Would your techniques always work after a failure?
- For the computer you are currently using, how should the operating system designers prioritize among reliability, security, portability, performance, and adoption? Explain why.
