## Exercises
- What is an example of an operating system as: Referee, Illusionist and Glue?
  - **As Referee, an operating system plays the role of a fair and impartial mediator, ensuring that all applications and users have equal access to the system's resources and that no one application or user can monopolize these resources.** For example, an operating system might prevent one program from using all of the available memory, thus ensuring that other programs have enough memory to run smoothly.
  - **As Illusionist, an operating system creates the illusion of a larger, more powerful computer than actually exists.** For example, an operating system might provide a virtual memory system that makes it appear as if there is more memory available than there actually is. This allows programs to use more memory than would be possible on a physical computer with the same amount of RAM.
  - **As Glue, an operating system provides a common set of services that applications can use, such as file I/O, networking, and security.** This allows applications to be written without having to worry about the underlying details of the hardware.
- What is the difference, if any, between the following terms:
  - Reliability vs. availability?
  - Security vs. privacy?
  - Security enforcement vs. security policy?
  - Throughput vs. response time?
  - Efficiency vs. overhead?
  - Application programming interface (API) vs. abstract virtual machine (AVM)?
  - Abstract virtual machine (AVM) vs. hardware abstraction layer (HAL)?
  - Proprietary vs. open operating system?
  - Batch vs. interactive operating system?
  - Host vs. guest operating system?
- Define the term, direct memory access (DMA).
  - For the following questions, take a moment to speculate. We provide answers to these questions throughout the book, but, given what you know now, how would you answer them? Before there were operating systems, someone needed to develop solutions without being able to look them up! How would you have designed the first operating system?

- Suppose a computer system and all of its applications were completely bug free. Suppose further that everyone in the world were completely honest and trustworthy. In other words, we need not consider fault isolation.
  - How should an operating system allocate time on the processor? Should it give the entire processor to each application until it no longer needs it? If there were multiple tasks ready to go at the same time, should it schedule first the task with the least amount of work to do or the one with the most? Justify your answer.
  - How should the operating system allocate physical memory to applications? What should happen if the set of applications does not fit in memory at the same time?
  - How should the operating system allocate its disk space? Should the first user to ask acquire all of the free space? What would the likely outcome be for that policy?
- Now suppose the computer system needs to support fault isolation. What hardware and/or operating support do you think would be needed to do the following?
  - Protect an application’s data structures in memory from being corrupted by other applications.
  - Protecting one user’s disk files from being accessed or corrupted by another user.
  - Protecting the network from a virus trying to use your computer to send spam.
- How should an operating system support communication between applications? Explain your reasoning.
  - Through the file system?
  - Through messages passed between applications?
  - Through regions of memory shared between the applications?
  - All of the above?
  - None of the above?
- How would you design combined hardware and software support to provide the illusion of a nearly infinite virtual memory on a limited amount of physical memory?
- How would you design a system to run an entire operating system as an application on top of another operating system?
- How would you design a system to update complex data structures on disk in a consistent fashion despite machine crashes?
- Society itself must grapple with managing resources. What ways do governments use to allocate resources, isolate misuse, and foster sharing in real life?
- Suppose you were tasked with designing and implementing an ultra-reliable and ultra-available operating system. What techniques would you use? What tests, if any, might be sufficient to convince you of the system’s reliability, short of handing your operating system to millions of users to serve as beta testers?
- MTTR, and therefore availability, can be improved by reducing the time to reboot a system after a failure. What techniques might you use to speed up booting? Would your techniques always work after a failure?
- For the computer you are currently using, how should the operating system designers prioritize among reliability, security, portability, performance, and adoption? Explain why.
